{"name":"WordPress Plugin Boilerplate","tagline":"The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate is an organized, maintainable boilerplate for building plugins using WordPress best practices.","body":"# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate\r\n\r\nThe WordPress Plugin Boilerplate serves as a foundation and aims to provide a clear and consistent guide for building your WordPress plugins. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* The Plugin Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)\r\n* Uses [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) conventions for easily following the code\r\n* Liberal use of `TODO` to guide you through what you need to change\r\n* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable\r\n* Note that this boilerplate uses `plugin.po` to provide a translation file. This is compatible with [POEdit](http://www.poedit.net/)\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\nThe WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:\r\n\r\n* This `README`\r\n* A subdirectory called `plugin-boilerplate`\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Copy the `plugin-boilerplate` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory\r\n2. Navigate to the *Plugins* dashboard page\r\n3. Locate the menu item that reads *TODO*\r\n4. Click on *Activate*\r\n\r\nThis will activate the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, nothing will be added to WordPress; however, this demonstrates exactly how your plugin should behave as you're working with it.\r\n\r\nIf you opt to uncomment Line 77 which contains the following line:\r\n\r\n`add_action( 'admin_menu', array( $this, 'plugin_admin_menu' ) );`\r\n\r\nThen a new menu item will be added to the *Plugins* menu.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe WordPress Plugin Boilerplate is licensed under the GPL v2 or later.\r\n\r\n> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2, as \r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
